<br>I learned the major pieces of the web; Me, my computer running a browser, the Internet, and Servers. <br>
We learned that the language used to communiate with the computer is called Hypertext Markup language. <br>
It is made up of text content (what you see), markings (what it looks like), and the reference. We also learned tags.<br>
There are different types of tags; opening and closing tags. There are also void tags. When you have <br> an opening tag with content
and a closing tag, these items together are called an element.<p> If I wanted to make an item italicized, the tag <em> makes them <br>

</em>italicized, but once I insert the closing tag, everything after the closing tag goes back to regular type. <br>
  I also learned that I can make words <b>bold</b> by using the "b" tag.<pr> We also learned about attributes. That
    means <br> I can use an attribute name like href and insert a website. One example we learned in class <br>
    is <a> href = "www.reddit.com"> derp"</a>
  </pr> 
</p> We learned that we can insert an image by using the tag <img src ="url" abt = "text"> This is blind text because images <br> don't have 
a closing tag.' They are called Void tags. An Anchor tag uses href attributes while image tags use src attributes. <br>
<p> We also learned about inline and block tags.</p>
<p> We learned hat a web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. <br> Web
  browserss read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
</p>Coding happens when programmers write text in a language a computer can understand. The  computer <br> which is a dumb machine, can follow the instructions the programmer wrote 
That being said, programmers need to write <br> "exactly" the way a  computer understands. This is
also known as writing with correct syntax. "
